## Second Largest Element in an Array

Find the second largest element in the given array.

**Optimal Approach:**  
Traverse the array and find largest and second largest in one pass.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Brute Force Approach:**
Sort the array and return second last element.
T.C=O(nlogn)
S.C=O(1) quick sort

**Better Approach:**
traverse the array twice and find second largest in second pass.
T.C=O(2n)
S.C=O(1)
